DMX Lighting Control Project

Welcome to the DMX Lighting Control Project! This project allows you to control lights and projectors using DMX (Digital Multiplex) channels, a standardized protocol used in the entertainment industry to control lighting and other stage equipment.

Getting Started 

To get started, you will need the following:

A DMX controller: This is the device that sends DMX signals to the lights and projectors. There are many different DMX controllers available, so be sure to choose one that meets your needs.

DMX lighting fixtures: These are the lights and projectors that you will be controlling. Each fixture has a unique DMX address, which you will use to control it via the DMX controller.

Cables: You will need DMX cables to connect the DMX controller to the lighting fixtures. Make sure you have enough cables to reach all of your fixtures.

Using the Project

To use the DMX Lighting Control Project over a network connection, you will need to follow these steps:

Set up your DMX controller and lighting fixtures according to the manufacturer's instructions, including any necessary network configurations.
Make sure that your DMX controller and lighting fixtures are connected to the same network.
Configure the DMX addresses for each fixture using the DMX controller's software or manual controls.
Use the DMX controller to control the lighting fixtures as desired over the network connection.
We hope you enjoy using the DMX Lighting Control Project! If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to contact us.
